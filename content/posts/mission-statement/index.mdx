I see this blog as a possibility to experiment with interesting things,
while I can document my journey into fields of technology I want to discover or improve on.

### Why I chose Gatsby for blogging
I wanted to challenge myself and React has been on my "Build something with..."-list forever.
After experimenting with some Gatsby-themes, I thought that I was shadowing a bit too much.
At that point, I did not want to learn how to write my own themes, so I looked for other interesting possibilities.
After reading an article on the [NuxtJS blog](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content),
I skipped VuePress and tried Nuxt and the [content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/).
I liked the MongoDB-like QueryBuilder API a bit more than GraphQL and it didn't take more than a few hours to set up a simple blog.
But after looking at the results, I thought:

> I want something more minimal

The next morning I got up and googled again.
I found a [minimal theme](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) by [Lekoarts](https://themes.lekoarts.de/),
that just fitted my needs and so I ended up with what I had begun with: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Thank you [Lekoarts](https://themes.lekoarts.de/) for this great theme!
