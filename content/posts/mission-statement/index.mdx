I see this blog as a possibility to experiment with interesting things,
while I can document my journey into fields of technology I want to discover or improve on.

### Why I chose Gatsby for blogging
From what I know best, Angular and Scully might have been a good fit. But I wanted to challenge myself and gain some new skills.

After experimenting with some Gatsby-Themes, I thought that I was shadowing a bit too much.
And at that point, I did not want to learn how to write my own theme, so I looked for other possibilities.
After reading an article on the [NuxtJS blog](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content), I skipped VuePress and tried Nuxt with the [content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). I liked the latter a bit more than being bound to GraphQL.
It didn't take long to set up a blog, and it was a pleasant experience, but after looking at the results, I thought:

> I want something more minimal

The next morning I got up and googled again.
I found a [minimal theme](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) by [Lekoarts](https://themes.lekoarts.de/),
that just fitted my needs and so I ended up with what I had begun with: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Thank you [Lekoarts](https://themes.lekoarts.de/) for this great theme!
