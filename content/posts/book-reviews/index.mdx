Homberg's book starts with the down-to-earth question:

> What's wrong with layers?

*[Tongue-in-cheek]: Yeah, what's wrong with them? Isn't every architect supposed to [leave a footprint][GeekAndPoke]?*

[![a comic strip where one guy tells the other that they gave up on finding names for the layers of their software layers and instead named them after their architects](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/518f5d62e4b075248d6a3f90/1373745203932-FY5OM0GGKZ3T2XIM9HMQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMjasjQ5vHSrE4vyy4Ye2dF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0vIHRucUU7a1Vci15HXS8HJMsCLbaTKQDWw2x2-mp2korvyeRU0zE932p8NLIfwQYw/footprints2.jpg?format=300w)](http://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2013/7/13/foodprints)

His arguments *against* a layered architecture are, that

- it promotes database-driven design,
- it is prone to shortcuts,
- it grows hard to test,
- it hides the use cases,
- it makes parallel work difficult.

He then recaps some of the [SOLID] principles and gives a coarse explanation of hexagonal architecture.

Before evolving an example implemented with Spring, he states his opinion about „How to organize code“.

*Hear, Hear! By that time I was glad I bought the book. For me, those chapters also could have been named
“Five things you dislike about your current project, __PLUS__ the one thing that really gets you mad!“*

After that, the reader learns how one implements a Use-Case, a Web-Adapter and a Persistence-Adapter. Every chapter closes with the recurring question: "How does this help me write maintainable software?".

The final chapters cover Testing, various ways of enforcing boundaries and different mapping strategies.

The book closes with a chapter on "Taking shortcuts consciously" and some hints for deciding on an architectural style.

The book has a nice and easy-to-read flow and almost zero filler. I thought, that introducing the [Broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)
in analogy to deteriorating codebases was a bit far-fetched, but that‘s nitpicking!

I really liked Hombergs well-balanced reasoning and felt like he is sincere in his intention to share his knowledge and experiences,
to enable his readers to make their own informed decisions, that fit their situations best.
