Writing a developer journey is harder than I thought. I can't think of a title that doesn't sound silly and
I am afraid, that someone will tell me how embarrassing and irrelevant this is. Anyway... 頑張ろう!

I had spent the last two weeks working on some feature that involved reworking entities and queries.
My coworker had a very similar task, but the tables he needed to use had surrogate keys, while the ones related to my part of work had natural keys.
The bottom line of the story is: I realized that natural keys are beautiful and feasible, but not as practical as having a surrogate key.
Having a generated ID _and_ some natural ID with a unique constraint on it (resp. on the columns that form a candidate key) might be
a good compromise. As I'm too lazy to type out code to explain what I mean, I'll have to link you to this [article].

Along the way I got to know some pitfalls with [equals() and  hashCode()] with Hibernate one has to mind when using [Hibernate with Kotlin] or [Lombok & Hibernate].
The [Spring Boot Kotlin Guide] mentions that data classes and JPA are not a good fit and I ended up doing it the way [this article] describes:

>  Also, it's a bit cumbersome to implement such behavior with data classes since we'd have to put the natural key parts

>  This does not feel right, so let's not do it...


I don't agree, that setting properties after construction feels wrong, but I agree that Kotlin data classes and JPA entities are not a good fit.
So let's save the data-classes for everything else than JPA-entities.

It really was fun doing lots of Hibernate. From rather unusual looking [derived queries] that traverse part of a [composite primary key]
to custom Spring Data queries that use typed queries via the entity manager, I got to know a lot of different ways to use Hibernate with Spring Data.
I feel much more comfortable with Hibernate now!

Learning always pays off: Yesterday I could give a working student a hint about using data classes with JPA.
And as he searched for an abstraction that would ~~rule them all~~ both fit Mongo- and JPA-Entities,
I told him about my experiences with wrong abstractions and that therefore I'd like to have a motivational poster that says:

> Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction ([Sandy Metz])

Though I didn't use it, reading about Hibernate lead me to reading about [JOOQ]. I don't know how many years ago I heard of JOOQ for the first time.
At that time it made a lot more sense to me than this ORM stuff I only had heard of.
JPA seemed like "real enterprise stuff" to me and back then at work (meaning assisting researchers at the university) we didn't use ORMs - we connected via JDBC and wrote SQL.

Thinking about databases and SQL, I am remembering how [Alejandro Buchmann] once offered me a free retry for my miserably botched oral exam in
[Database Systems II] and how he had said one of the nicest things anyone ever said to me (roughly memorized):

> "I don't know what was wrong today...I thought you'd do better...But I firmly believe, that if you'll ever need it, **you can do it!**"

As cocky as it may sound: He was right. I can do it. Everyday. Like a man!
