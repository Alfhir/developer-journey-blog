I have some experience with [Angular] and I'm working with [Aurelia] on a day to day basis.
So [Scully] might have been an option for a [JAM-Stack]() based blog.

But React had been on my "Build something with..." list for quite a while and I had fun doing the [NextJS] tutorial and
(some of) the [100 Days Of Gatsby] challenges. Yet after experimenting with some Gatsby themes, I thought that I was shadowing a bit too much.
And at that point, I did not want to learn how to write my own theme, so I looked for other possibilities.

After reading an [article](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content) on the NuxtJS blog,
I wanted to try Nuxt with the [content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) as an alternative to [TinaCMS].
I liked the MongoDB-like QueryBuilder API of the content module and setting up a simple blog was easy.
But before my curiosity led me to trying [Gridsome] and [VuePress], I thought it all over and understood one important thing:

> I want to try out a lot of things. I am allowed to have fun and try [ELM].
> But I need to be pragmatic about the blogging tool and get started already.

So I went back to zero and looked for a minimal Gatsby-Theme.
I found a [starter](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) by [Lekoarts](https://themes.lekoarts.de/)
that perfectly fitted my needs and that is how I ended up with what I had begun with.
